A repository for my data structure codes from class.

AirplaneRegistry.java

A class that works as a hash map of airplane linkedList. If the tail number of the airplane to be inserted isn't already in the hash map, we insert the airplane at the beginning of the corresponding linkedList based on it's hash function (its key).



Gazillion.java

Java has a max value of long integer that can be processed and used in operations. This class allows us to add or multiply very large numbers with an "unlimited" number of digits.
